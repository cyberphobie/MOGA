Make bigOil Great Again!

!Credits to TdlQ and Dr_Newbie!

This will change the second day of BigOil:
  - If a clipboard is picked up, it gets transferred to the Whiteboard in the basement (synced between all players)
  - If both clipboards are found, the correct engine will be marked (not synced yet)
  
INSTALLATION:
  - requires BLT2 or SuperBLT
  - simply copy the "Make bigOil Great Again"-Folder into your mods folder
  
KNOWN ISSUES:
- Waypoints are not synced between players. Currently, only the player picking up the second clipboard will see the correct engine.
- This mod currently ignores the existence of the computer showing the pressure. This feature might not be added.
